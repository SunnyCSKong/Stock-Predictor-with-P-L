An application that predicts stock prices using an LSTM model, then uses multi-leg options strategies (collar/strangle/straddle) to predict a potential profit/loss.

Use a simple moving average (SMA) or exponential moving average (EMA) to help! Select from a large number of public companies. 
See: price history; how the data was split; predicted prices for the next day and the predicted price in a month; option pricing for the options strategies AND the Black-Scholes Merton values for both puts and calls.

Note: the Black-Scholes Merton formula assumes the ticker does not have any derivatives.
This is only for demonstrative purposes, and may not provide an accurate prediction.
